Run Time Complexity


NAME 			EQUATION	EXPLINATION: EXAMPLE

constant		1			Same amount of time regardless 
							of additional elements

Logarythimic	log(N) 		If doubling the amount of elements does 
							not double the work : 
								- Search Operations

Linear			N			Iterating through an array : 
								- Simple Loops

Quasi-linear	N * log(N) 	Doubling the amount fo elements 
							does not double the amount of work :
								- Sorting Operations

Quadratic		N^2 		Every Element is compared to 
							every other element in a collection

Exponential		2^N 		Adding a single element doubles
							the processing effort :
								- Fibonacci Recursion
